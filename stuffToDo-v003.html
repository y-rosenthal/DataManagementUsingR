<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- This is a comment in HTML (and in XML). -->
<!-- 
 The "DOCTYPE" is generally found on the first line.
 
 The primary purpose of a DOCTYPE is to tell browser and other 
 software that use the file which set of rules to follow when 
 interpreting the document, which is most relevant for SGML and XML-based formats.
 
 The DOCTYPE tells the browser (or other software that uses 
 the file) what version of HTML or other 
 language is included in the file.
 
 The DOCTYPE shown above says that this file follows the rules
 of HTML 5. Starting the HTML 5, the doctype simply needs to say "html".
 Earlier versions of HTML required much more complex DOCTYPEs.
 There are other DOCTYPE declarations for other types of files
 most of which are some sort of XML or similar file type.

  	<h1>About this webpage</h1>
    <div style="background-color: lightgrey; 
                color: blue;
                border: 1px solid black;
                padding: 0px 5px;
                margin: 0px 5px;">
                
        <p>Webpages are coded with a combination of three different languages:
           HTML, CSS and Javascript. The different languages can be located in different 
           files. They can also all be combined in a single file with a .html extension.</p>
           
        <p>The code for this webpage is located in a single .html file and is
           intended to introduce how to use various HTML tags and attributes. 
           In a later lesson we will focus more on CSS and Javascript. 
           Note that this file contains mostly HTML with a minimal amount of CSS code.
           There is NO Javascript code in this file.
           The CSS code appears in the style elements and style attributes found in this page.<br />

           <blockquote>
           <strong>style elements</strong>:<br />
           <strong><span style="color:red;font-size:125%;"> &lt;style&gt; <em>css code goes here</em> &lt/style&gt;</span></strong>
           <br /><br /> 
           
           <strong>style attributes</strong>: e.g.<br />
           <strong><span style="color:red;font-size:125%">&lt;div  style="<em>css code goes here</em>"&gt;...&lt;div&gt</span></strong> and<br />
           <strong><span style="color:red;font-size:125%">&lt;span  style="<em>css code goes here</em>"&gt;...&lt;span&gt</span></strong>
           </blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>To work with this code do the following:</p>        
           
        <ul>
          <li>To <strong><em>see the "rendered page"</em></strong> in a browser, double click
           on the html filename.</li>

          <li>To <strong><em>edit</em></strong> this code, you must open up this file
          in a <em>"text editor".</em></li>

          <li>You can also <em><strong>view</strong></em> this code in the browser by
          doing one of the following things.
          
              <ol>
                <li><strong>"view source"</strong>: right click on a blank section of the 
                    page and choose <strong>"view source"</strong>
                    <em>(or something similar - the exact text of the menu choice may be 
                    different from browser to browser)</em>.
                    This opens a simple view of the entire HTML file.
                    
                <li><strong>"inspect"</strong>: Right click on a any part of the page
                    and choose <strong>"inspect"</strong>
                    <em>(or something similar - the exact text of the menu choice may be 
                    different from browser to browser)</em>.
                    The inspect option opens the HTML in the "browser tools".
                    These tools are used by software developers to help 
                    debug problems with the web page. The HTML will open
                    to the exact HTML code that is used to "render" the 
                    portion of the page that you clicked on. 
                </li>
              </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>

   <h1>Another way of organizing the TODO items.</h1>

    <p>Tables are useful for displaying data in rows and columns.
       Here's an example of a simple HTML table that organizes our 
       to-do items:</p>
    
    <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 80%; margin: 20px 5px;">
      <tr>
        <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px; background-color: lightgrey; text-align: left;">Day</th>
        <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px; background-color: lightgrey; text-align: left;">School Stuff</th>
        <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px; background-color: lightgrey; text-align: left;">Other Stuff</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px; vertical-align: top;">Monday</td>
        <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">
          <ul>
            <li>Do math homework</li>
            <li>Study for Tuesday's English test</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
        <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">
          <ul>
            <li>Pay electric bill</li>
            <li>Call Joe to say hi</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px; vertical-align: top;">Tuesday</td>
        <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">
          <ul>
            <li>Take the test</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
        <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">
          <ol>
            <li>Buy an umbrella
              <div style="margin-top: 5px;">
                <img src="yellowUmbrella.png" width="50" alt="a picture of an umbrella" />
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>Make vacation plans</li>
            <li>Relax after a full night of studying</li>
          </ol>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <!-- 
      The table element creates the table structure.
      <tr> defines a table row.
      <th> defines a table header cell.
      <td> defines a regular table data cell.
      
      Notice how table cells can contain complex HTML elements:
      - Unordered lists (ul)
      - Ordered lists (ol)
      - Images (img)
      - Divs and other structural elements
      
      The style attributes above add borders, spacing, and colors
      to make the table more readable. In a real-world scenario,
      you would typically use CSS in the <style> section or in a
      separate CSS file instead of inline styles.
